Aim of this project was to improve our grip on *Rust*.
//In this project we have created a simple program which would use an API
and will print all the latest BBC International News headline with a link
below it to get to the full news article. To add a twist we changed the 
colour of the news headline to yellow and the hyperlink to cyan so it is 
better looking for the viewers. Below is the output of the project!
